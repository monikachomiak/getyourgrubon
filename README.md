# Title
Get Your Grub On
# Project Description
This project is intended to showcase our progress as students in the Web Development bootcamp thus far. Our motivation for development was to create a quick and efficient way for everyday people to access a variety of recipes to enjoy, whether they are feeding a family or themselves. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Tasty API.
# Expected Behavior
When a user opens the page, they will see a navigation bar on the right side of the header that displays 4 links: About Us, Instructions, Search Recipes, and Hit Us Up. When clicking on any one of these links, the UI will direct them to that section of the page.
When a user views the page, they will find that the HTML elements meet accessibility standards and fall in sequential order.
When a user views the page, they will find step by step instructinos guiding them on how to use the website.
When a user views the page, they will be able to search a recipe by typing it into the field box and clicking the Search Recipes button. It will return 6 results.
