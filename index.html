<h2>About Us</h2>
<img src="./images/dogcart.jpeg" alt="dog pushing a shopping cart holding money">
<p>Get Your Grub On was started in Austin, TX by 4 hungry friends who were tired of eating the same 5 things every week. We wanted to create a quick and efficient way to help our community rise to amateur home culinary excellence by providing a multitude of recipes to enjoy, whether you live alone or are feeding a family. Our goal is to provide an avenue for healthy and fulfilling recipes to nourish the body and mind. We're also open to days where chili cheese fries are calling your name, because let's be real...everyone needs chili cheese fries in their life from time to time. We hope you enjoy using our site!</p>
